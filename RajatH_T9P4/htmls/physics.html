<div id="comment"><h2>Comments From Our Physics Customers</h2>

    <p>
        "When I said I was going to teach holography, everyone figured I had busted the budget. That was before they
        heard
        about your excellent hologram kit."
        M. Roussiani. Bismark, ND

        "My second graders loved the gyroscopes! And - miracle of miracles - the gyroscopes survived the encounter."
        M. Larson. Oak Park, IL

        "The laser kit was up to your usual excellent standards, and the enclosed lesson plans saved me a weekend's
        worth of
        work."
        T. Barnett. Seattle, WA

<div id="extra"><h2>Newton and the Apple</h2>

    <p>
        Okay, we all know the story of Isaac Newton getting hit in the head with the apple, but is this story true?
        Well,
        not
        exactly, but there's more truth to it than you might think.

        Newton grew up on a farm, where he certainly saw many apples fall from trees. As a young man, Newton recalled
        those
        apples and wondered whether the same force that causes apples to fall would account for the motion of the moon
        across
        the sky.

        Newton applied his newly-discovered mathematical technique, calculus (he called his technique fluxions) to the
        problem
        and deduced that, if his assumption was correct, the moon would orbit the Earth every 29.5 days. That's pretty
        close
        to
        the actual figure of 27.3 days.

        So, no, Newton did not get hit with an apple, but he did get hit with a pretty good idea - thanks to an apple.
